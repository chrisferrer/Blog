My reaction when I download an app that I thought was free only to see a “thank you for your purchasing” receipt in my email inbox.

I think Ron Burgundy above captures my feelings exactly. Until I open the email and see the total is $0.00. So now I’m a little perplexed. Now, this isn’t the end of the world by any means, however, it creates confusion and sometimes a little panic, which could be avoided. Another example of this is how the app store on Mac desktop at times asks for payment information when downloading a free app, and even when downloading a purchased app onto a new device.

Rather than shocking people, a simple “Receipt for your free app” or "Receipt for your app" would do just fine and assuage all the worries that might sprout up.

A few other things that could be improved with this checkout process is taking advantage of the email real estate. For example, this receipt is a perfect place to highlight promotions, which Playstation has done to some extent. Even though I already have Playstation plus, promoting another service like Playstation Vue or something new and exciting in the pipeline would work perfectly here. On the other hand, Playstation may want to emphasize the benefits from already having Playstation plus.
