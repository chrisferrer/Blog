My reaction when I download an app that I thought was free only to see a “thank you for your purchase” receipt in my email inbox.

I think the gif captures my feelings exactly until I open the email in a tizzy and see the total is $0.00. Now this isn’t the end of the world by any means, however, it doesn’t provide the best product experience. The app store on Mac desktop used to ask for payment information when downloading a free app and as you can see below Playstation sends these pesky emails.

Rather than shocking people a simple “Receipt for your free app” would do just fine and assuage all the worries that might sprout among users.

A few other things that could be improved with this checkout process is taking advantage of the email real estate. For example, the receipt is a perfect place to place promotions, which Playstation has done, however, I already have Playstation plus so promoting another service like Vue would be perfect here. On the other hand Playstation may want to emphasize the benefits that I get from already having Playstation plus.
