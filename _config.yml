profile: Chris grew up in Hawaii, and now lives in chilly San Francisco. A philosopher by trade, and a product manager by day at FutureAdvisor (a Blackrock company). He moonlights as an ahi poke chef and can be found watching the Chelsea Football Club weekends at the crack of dawn due to an unfortunate time difference from England.
